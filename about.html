  <h2 style="text-align:center;">About me.</h2>
 <p> My name is Jingles.  I'm currently looking to obtain a position in managing finances as well as other things in any sort of setting that requires my skills.  I have a Bachelor's Degree in accounting from <a href="https://lsu.edu/">Lousiana state university </a>, and 5 years of expereince in the field under my collar. My work ethic is strong and is unfaltering, even under the greatest of pressure. I am great with children and the elderly of all ages. I cannot wait to hear from you soon!
 
 <h3 style="text-align:center;">Personal life </h3>
